# WS2812B-LED-E131-IOT

This drives the WS2812B led, with E1.31 protocol. I essentially did stuff from scratch, communicating with the WS2812B using PWM signals, and communicating 
wirelessly from the computer using Wi-Fi AT commands. I used the STM32L475 MCU, but it shouldn't really matter.


*Note: * Go to the folder "Core" for the main code, the others are essential libraries and configuriations.
